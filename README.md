# Project: Traffic and Taxi Scheduling using NYC Yellow Taxi Data
This project focuses on predicting traffic volume and optimizing taxi scheduling in New York City using historical data from the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset. By analyzing the patterns in taxi pickups, drop-offs, and traffic conditions over a period of six months, the goal is to develop predictive models that can help improve traffic management and taxi availability in the city. The dataset includes key features such as pickup times, locations, trip distances, and passenger counts, which were preprocessed and used to train machine learning models.

We utilized Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and model development. Key models implemented include Random Forest Classifier/Regressor and XGBoost to predict traffic volume and optimize taxi distribution. These models were selected for their efficiency in handling large datasets and their ability to capture complex patterns in traffic data. The predictions from these models provide valuable insights for optimizing traffic light control, improving taxi dispatching, and ultimately enhancing urban transportation systems.
